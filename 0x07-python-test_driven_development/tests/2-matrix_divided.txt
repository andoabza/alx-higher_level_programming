    """
    Divide each element of a matrix by a divisor and round to 2 decimal places.

    Args:
        matrix (list): A matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats.
        div (int or float): The divisor.

    Returns:
        list: A new matrix where each element is divided by the divisor and rounded to 2 decimal places.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If matrix is not a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats,
                   or if each row of the matrix does not have the same size,
                   or if div is not a number.
        ZeroDivisionError: If div is zero.

    Examples:
        >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
        >>> div = 2
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
        [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0], [3.5, 4.0, 4.5]]

        >>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
        >>> div = 0
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

        >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]
        >>> div = 2
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
